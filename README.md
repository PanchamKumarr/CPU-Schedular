# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Visualization

This project visualizes various CPU Scheduling algorithms through a user-friendly interface created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The algorithms included are:
1. **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**
2. **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
3. **Round Robin (RR)**
4. **Priority Based Scheduling**
5. **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**
6. **Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling**

The goal of this project is to provide a clear and interactive visualization of how these algorithms allocate CPU time to processes, helping users understand the inner workings of CPU scheduling.

## Key Features:
- Visual representations of various CPU Scheduling algorithms.
- Interactive user interface to choose different algorithms and visualize their performance.
- Explanations of each algorithm's working principle, advantages, and disadvantages.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For structuring the content and layout.
- **CSS**: For styling the website and creating a visually appealing design.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic of CPU scheduling algorithms and interactive functionality.

## How to Run Locally:
