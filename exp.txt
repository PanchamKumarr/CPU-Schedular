CPU Scheduling Algorithms Explanations:

1) **First Come First Serve (FCFS)**:
   FCFS is the simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. The process that requests the CPU first is allocated the CPU time. It follows a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) approach.
   
   Advantages:
   - Simple and easy to understand.
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Processes with shorter burst times suffer, leading to long waiting times.
   - Favors CPU-bound processes over I/O-bound processes.

2) **Shortest Job First (SJF)**:
   In this non-preemptive algorithm, the process with the shortest burst time is given priority. It minimizes the average waiting time but can cause starvation for longer processes.
   
   Advantages:
   - Minimizes average waiting time.
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Can cause starvation for longer processes.
   - Not ideal for time-sharing systems.

3) **Round Robin (RR)**:
   Round Robin is a preemptive algorithm where each process is given a fixed time slice (quantum). After a process uses its quantum, it is placed at the end of the queue, and the next process is executed.
   
   Advantages:
   - Fair distribution of CPU time.
   - Easy to implement and suitable for time-sharing systems.
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Can lead to high turnaround time.
   - The choice of the quantum size is crucial for performance.

4) **Priority Based Scheduling**:
   In this algorithm, each process is assigned a priority. The process with the highest priority is executed first. If two processes have the same priority, they are scheduled in FCFS order.
   
   Advantages:
   - Ensures that high-priority tasks are completed first.
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Low-priority processes can starve if there are constant high-priority tasks.

---

5) **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)**:
   SRTF is a preemptive version of SJF. The process with the shortest remaining burst time is executed first.
   
   Advantages:
   - Reduces the average waiting time.
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Can lead to starvation for longer processes.

---

6) **Multiple-Level Queues Scheduling**:
   In this algorithm, processes are divided into multiple queues based on priority or characteristics. Each queue uses a different scheduling algorithm (e.g., FCFS for one queue, RR for another).
   
   Advantages:
   - Provides a flexible approach to managing processes.
   - Can prioritize critical processes by placing them in higher-priority queues.
   
   Disadvantages:
   - Complicated to implement.
   - Processes may suffer starvation if they are placed in lower-priority queues.
